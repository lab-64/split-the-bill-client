Interactions outside the app

This directory is supposed to hold all the interactions that transact the data from outside the app.
 This is different from the cloud functions, in regards to that none of the code in this directory
 will interact will cloud storage or server. If we take into consideration a weather app a good
 example would be the weather and the location data that is received from the API in the form of
 JSON that needs to be translated for use.
