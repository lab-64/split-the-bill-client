Widgets / Layouts used in the app

It becomes clear all by the name itself that this folder will hold all the static widgets or the
widgets that are used multiple times in the application. For example, if it is a social media app
like Instagram, the list view of all the suggested friends is always the same, the only thing that
changes in the data.  Or if it is a weather app the tile which shows a particular location is the
same for all the location, the only thing that change is the name of the place.
