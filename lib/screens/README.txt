Screen /UI of the app

This directory will contain the actual layout of the UI for the entire application.
It can further be distributed into two-three folders. One which stored the flash screen and
onboarding pages such as login/sign-up screen, the second folder can store the home screen and
other generally used screens, and the third folder can contain screens that are not that important
