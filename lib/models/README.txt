Collection of data

Models are the collection of data that are usually sourced from the servers,
users, or external APIs, these are used in combination with widgets to complete
the user interface of the app. Again, taking an example of the weather app a model
or a set of data could be the name of the location, temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
If we take into consideration a social media app that is showing a userâ€™s profile page then it may
contain the username, age, a profile pic, a description, etc.
